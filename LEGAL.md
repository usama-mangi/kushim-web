# KUSHIM: Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) Legal Documentation Summary

This document summarizes KUSHIM's commitment as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), legally binding its operations to both profit generation and a specific public benefit.

## Public Benefit Mission

KUSHIM's public benefit mission is to **track and verify the true ecological and social resilience embedded in supply chains, thereby ensuring the long-term viability and civilizational resilience of our planet's natural and human capital.**

We aim to:
*   Provide transparent, auditable, and immutable data on resource utilization and impact.
*   Incentivize sustainable practices through economic mechanisms (e.g., K-Score, adjusted risk pricing).
*   Foster a global economy that values and rewards ecological and social stewardship.
*   Maintain an open and ungameable protocol for assessing real-world value.

## Accountability and Reporting

As a PBC, KUSHIM is legally obligated to:
1.  **Balance Shareholder Interests with Public Benefit**: Our Board of Directors and officers must consider the impact of any action or inaction on our public benefit mission, alongside the financial interests of shareholders.
2.  **Public Benefit Report**: We will publicly publish an annual report assessing our overall social and environmental performance against our stated public benefit mission, using third-party standards where appropriate. This report will be provided to shareholders and made available to the public.
3.  **Transparency**: Our commitment to transparency extends to our governance (Feature 12.1) and open-source contributions (Feature 12.2).

## Fiduciary Duty

Our corporate structure as a Public Benefit Corporation ensures that our fiduciary duty explicitly includes our public benefit mission. This legal framework prevents a purely extractive sale or strategic shift that would undermine our core purpose, aligning long-term value creation with planetary and societal well-being.

## Investor Alignment

This PBC status is a cornerstone of our long-term vision, ensuring that investors are aligned with a mission-driven enterprise built for durable, positive impact beyond short-term financial gains. It secures our position as an indispensable infrastructure for the resilience economy.
